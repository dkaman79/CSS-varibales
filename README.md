# CSS-varibales
This project in the 3rd project in JavaScript 30 challenge.
It is a mini project on updating variables using JS. So, we give some CSS effects to this page such as Blur, Spacing & Color and then changing those variables in real time with JavaScript. 
Many mini projects are yet to come.
Byeeee!
